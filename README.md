# Optical Character Recognition for Devanagari Handwritten script
## Introduction: 
Devanagari is the national font of Nepal and is used widely throughout India also. It contains 10 numerals(०, १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९) and 36 consonants (क, ख, ग, घ, ङ, च, छ, ज, झ, ञ, ट, ठ, ड, ढ, ण, त, थ, द, ध,न, प,फ, ब, भ, म, य, र, ल, व, श, ष, स, ह, क्ष, त्र, ज्ञ). Some consonants are complex and made by combining others. However, throughout this project, I considered them as single characters. The required dataset is publicly available at https://web.archive.org/web/20160307001701/http://cvresearchnepal.com/wordpress/dhcd/.

# Implementation

For this project, I am using Python 3.9. More importantly, I am running it on Jupyter Notebook as well as Google Colab. For model training/testing, Colab is used. For real-world image recognition, I used my Intel I5 with 8 GB RAM. The dependencies and libraries I used are:
Python 3.9
Numpy
Matplotlib
OpenCV
Pandas
RandomForestClassifier
ExtraTreesClassifier
KNeighborsClassifier
tree
NearestCentroid

# Procedure of Implementation
1)  Collecting datasets from different sources.
2)  Preprocess the datasets, In my case, the datasets are already preprocessed so no need to preprocess the data.
3)  Feature extraction
4)  Hybrid Model
5)  Final Output.
